You can set a theme for Harlequin, passing the name of any [Pygments style](https://pygments.org/styles/) to the `--theme` or `-t` option.

Depending on the number of colors supported by your terminal, some themes may not look great. For any terminal, we can recommend `monokai` (the default), `zenburn`, `github-dark`, `fruity`, `native` and `one-dark`.

```bash
harlequin --theme one-dark
```

For a gallery of many of the better-looking themes, see the [homepage](/#themes).
